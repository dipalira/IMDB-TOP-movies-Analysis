# IMDB-TOP-movies-Analysis
**Abstract** Our project is intended for users that want to discover new movies they may not have seen yet. More specifically, it will help users find movies that are related to movies they have watched while also maintaining a similar rating. Our project does topic analysis on the top and bottom 250 user rated movies on IMDb (a reliable source to find movie ratings) and generates multiple dynamic graphs. It is useful because it facilitates searching for a new movie by focusing on the visualization of the data, making it easier to analyze. We have published some of these visualizations on a web page for people to explore, which can be seen by opening index.html from the GitLab repository.  <https://gitlab-beta.engr.illinois.edu/jmoral39/cs410project>
